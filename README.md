# Ecom.com is an Ecommerce website built on the React front-end framework, with an Express back-end, and a MongoDB database.
Ecom.com utilizes React hooks such as useEffect and useState, coupled with the axios node module to request page data from the back-end. User’s cart data is persisted using React/Redux and is saved in local storage to persist cart items even after signing out. Transactions are handled securely by the Stripe API/node module. This project uses functional login and registration with mongoose queries, and leverages the Bcrypt node module for password security. This project has been designed with mobile-use in mind and is styled reactively, using CSS Grid layout and “@media” queries to change the page layout to fit the browsing device
